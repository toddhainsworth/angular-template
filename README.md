# Angular Template

This project is used to write new Angular JS applications without
the tedious file structure setup phase.

Inspired by the [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
project, the project is designed around the way I write Angular JS code. While it might not be the "best" way
to do things for each case, it's the way I've found most comfortable.

## Usage

Clone the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/toddhainsworth/angular-template.git <project-name> && cd <project-name>
```

Install dependencies

```
$ npm install && bower install
```

Start the app

```
$ npm start
```

Now go write an awesome Angular app!
